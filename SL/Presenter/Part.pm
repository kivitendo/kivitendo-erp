=head1 NAME

SL::Presenter::Part - Part related presenter stuff

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Create an html link for editing/opening a part/service/assembly
  my $object = my $object = SL::DB::Manager::Part->get_first;
  my $html   = SL::Presenter->get->part($object, display => 'inline');

see also L<SL::Presenter>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

see L<SL::Presenter>

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 2

=item C<part, $object, %params>

Returns a rendered version (actually an instance of
L<SL::Presenter::EscapedText>) of the part object C<$object>

C<%params> can include:

=over 4

=item * display

Either C<inline> (the default) or C<table-cell>. At the moment both
representations are identical and produce the part's name linked
to the corresponding 'edit' action.

=back

=over 2

=item C<part_picker $name, $value, %params>

All-in-one picker widget for parts. The name will be both id and name
of the resulting hidden C<id> input field (but the ID can be
overwritten with C<$params{id}>).

An additional dummy input will be generated which is used to find
parts. For a detailed description of its behaviour, see section
C<PART PICKER SPECIFICATION>.

C<$value> can be a parts id or a C<Rose::DB:Object> instance.

If C<%params> contains C<part_type> only parts of this type will be used
for autocompletion. You may comma separate multiple types as in
C<part,assembly>.

If C<%params> contains C<unit> only parts with this unit will be used
for autocompletion. You may comma separate multiple units as in
C<h,min>.

If C<%params> contains C<convertible_unit> only parts with a unit
that's convertible to unit will be used for autocompletion.

Obsolete parts will by default not be displayed for selection. However they are
accepted as default values and can persist during updates. As with other
selectors though, they are not selectable once overridden.

C<part_picker> will register it's javascript for inclusion in the next header
rendering. If you write a standard controller that only call C<render> once, it
will just work.  In case the header is generated in a different render call
(multiple blocks, ajax, old C<bin/mozilla> style controllers) you need to
include C<js/autocomplete_part.js> yourself.

=head1 PART PICKER SPECIFICATION

The following list of design goals were applied:

=over 4

=item *

Parts should not be perceived by the user as distinct inputs of partnumber and
description but as a single object

=item *

Easy to use without documentation for novice users

=item *

Fast to use with keyboard for experienced users

=item *

Possible to use without any keyboard interaction for mouse (or touchscreen)
users

=item *

Must not leave the current page in event of ambiguity (cf. current select_item
mechanism)

=item *

Should be useable with hand scanners or similar alternative keyboard devices

=item *

Should not require a feedback/check loop in the common case

=item *

Should not be constrained to exact matches

=back

The implementation consists of the following parts which will be referenced later:

=over 4

=item 1

A hidden input (id input), used to hold the id of the selected part. The only
input that gets submitted

=item 2

An input (dummy input) containing a description of the currently selected part,
also used by the user to search for parts

=item 3

A jquery.autocomplete mechanism attached to the dummy field

=item 4

A popup layer for both feedback and input of additional data in case of
ambiguity.

=item 5

An internal status of the part picker, indicating whether id input and dummy
input are consistent. After leaving the dummy input the part picker must
place itself in a consistent status.

=item 6

A clickable icon (popup trigger) attached to the dummy input, which triggers the popup layer.

=back

=head1 BUGS

None atm :)
